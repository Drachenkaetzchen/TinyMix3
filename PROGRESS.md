Checked PSU voltages, +5V and +9V are OK. Missing µC, next time fit all components and test if the circuit works.

Probably replace the 90° connectors with something else. but FPC seems to be too expensive…

Probably replace TS912 with TS922 because it can drive headphones.

Move D3 closer to the inside of the board to avoid short circuits.

Problems spotted:

* Mixing resistors in the outputs (10k) plus feedback opamp resistor (10k) missing
* Footprint of line jacks are mirrored, needs fixing
* Mixer doesn't mix, check out why

* Changed mirrored connectors

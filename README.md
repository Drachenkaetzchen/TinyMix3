## Design

Heart of the TinyMix3 is the TDA7448. It is a 6 channel mono / 3 channel stereo mixer controlled via IÂ²C. For combining
the 3 stereo channels into a single stereo output, the TS912 rail-to-rail OpAmp is used. The main logic is implemented
using an Atmega8, which uses V-USB to provide USB control. It also implements the touch interface and controls the LEDs
on the front panel.
